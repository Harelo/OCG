<h1><b>OCG - One Command Generator</h1></b>

A generator that creates a "One Command" format from multiple commands (Minecraft).<br/>
Open it on your machine by launching OneCommandGenerator.exe from the bin/Debug directory.<br/>
To use, simply put in the commands you want to turn into the one-command format, keep in mind - the way this generatory works is that <br/>
a machine will be spawned which will then run the commands you picked over and over again.
